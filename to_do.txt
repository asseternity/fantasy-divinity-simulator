--- IDEA ---

1. generate a simple fantasy map with just hexagons: each hexagon is a province. 

2. each province has a certain level of "knowing about you", "liking you" or "not liking you" 

3. you are a newborn god. three random virtues / vices / concepts pop up. you choose one to be your starting, what are you a god of. 

4. your goal is to level up your godhood. you do that by doing things associated with your chosen "what are you the god of". 
as you level up, you will get 3 more random virtues / vices / concepts and can choose on emore. 
so eventually you can be "god of X, Y and Z." not every virtue will be equally easy to level with but that's the idea. 
it's not meant to be balanced. it's meant to be a story. it's a single player game. 

5. you level up by recruiting champions (randomly generated characters). 
you click on a province and can get a number and quality of recruits based on how liked/known you are in the province
(if you're unknown and/or unliked, you'll get shitty recruits). 
then choose one. then send them on "divine tasks" to provinces. 
these "divine tasks" can be doing good things or doing bad things to the province. 
random results based on champion personalities and skills. 

6. you have to progress the time as you look at the map. 
"divine tasks" take a certain number of turns. random events may happen as you progress - both concerning your champions and random provinces.

7. some kind of currency to manage - use it to roll for recruits, send for missions, etc. 

so, what I want to do is kind of like procedurally generated fantasy goofy crusader kings dwarf fortress.

--- TO DOs ---

[v] create a hex grid
[v] randomly generated grids
[v] clickable effects on tiles
[_] make geography type names dependent on tile types
[_] Tile metadata - attach province stats (favor, awareness, resources, population) to each tile
[_] ...
[_] at the end of a run -> give a summary on how the run went:
- what was your deity of, your resource counts, most difficult missions, top champions
